## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my undergraduate degree in Biotechnology Engineering, currently in my second year.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R programming and data analytics.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on bioinformatics, my main area of interest.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding which skills I can learn or enhance that would be useful for future employability and personal learning growth.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything I have done/ if you would like to collaborate or understand more about my work!

ğŸ“« How to reach me: My email id: ira.mitmpl2024@learner.manipal.edu

ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

âš¡ Fun fact: I love learning new things in most fields. Outside of coding and biology, my passions include music, politics, and fitness, among many others.
